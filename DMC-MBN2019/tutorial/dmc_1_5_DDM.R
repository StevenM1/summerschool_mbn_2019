### Lesson 1.5 Exploring the DDM model

# This lesson is about familiarising yourself with the DDM model and its 
# parameters, and how you can create different scenarios with different 
# parameter values. See Ratcliff, R., & McKoon, G. (2008). The diffusion 
# decision model: Theory and data for two-choice decision tasks. Neural 
# Computation, 20(4), 873â€“922.

# Start with a simple design with a binary stimulus factor, S 
# (e.g, left vs. right motion) and corresponding responses.  
factors=list(S=c("left","right"))
responses=c("LEFT","RIGHT")
match.map=list(M=list(left="LEFT",right="RIGHT"))

# NB1: See ?ddiffusion for rtdists help on parameters. However note that we differ
#      from rtdists in defining z (the start point) relative to a (the boundary). 
#      That is, if the absolute start point is Z then z = Z/a, where 0 < z < 1. 
#      Similarly, sz, start point noise (i.e., the width of the uniform 
#      distribution around z of start points) is defined as a proportion of a, 
#      so if SZ is the absolute start point distribution width then sz = SZ/a.
#      Note also that t0 is the LOWER BOUND of the non-decision time
#      distribution (in this case this is true in both rtdists and in DMC) so, 
#      that mean non-decision time is t0 + st/2, where st is the width of the
#      uniform distribution of non-decision time. These parameterization of 
#      z, sz and t0 are all adopted so that the parameters can be restricted to
#      their proper range by priors bounded by absolute values (i.e, 0 < z < 1,
#      0 < sz < 1, t0 > 0 and st > 0) rather than having to provide relative 
#      bounds (e.g., Z < a etc.)
# NB2: Like the LNR, for the DDM there is no need to fix a parameter (by
#      default moment-to-moment variability s=1 is assumed, see rtdists). 
#      Constants are set here just to focus on the computationally faster 
#      version with no non-decision variability (st0=0) and with no difference
#      in non-decision time between responses (d=0). When st0>0 it gets slow!
# NB3: Because there is only one accumulator the M and R factors cannot
#      appear in p.map
# NB4: Negative v is mapped to the error boundary and positive to correct 
#      boundary, so estimates are generally positive.
# NB5: Note that the left response corresponds to the bottom boundary (at 0) 
#      and the right response to the top boundary (at a)
# NB6: The underlying code calculating the DDM likelihood uses numerical 
#      integration in C and can crash when given parameters outside and even 
#      sometimes very near the boundaries over which each parameter is defined.
#      In order to avoid these problems parameters are checked as follows and
#      a zero likelihood returned (see transfrom.dmc in ddm.R)
#      bad <- function(p) 
#      {
#        (p$a[1]<0)      | (p$z[1] <1e-6) | (p$z[1] >.999999) | (p$t0[1]<1e-6)  | 
#        (p$sz[1]<0) | (p$st0[1]<0)    | (p$sv[1]<0) |
#        (p$sz[1]>1.999999*min(c(p$z[1],1-p$z[1]))) 
#      }
#      Note that sz has a rather complicated from becasue we have to make sure 
#      that both 0 < Z - SZ/2 and Z + SZ/2 < a. This is the same as 0 < z-sz/2
#      and z+sz/2 < 1 or jointly sz/2 < min(z,1-z).
# NB7: The d parameter (difference in t0 between responses, positive values = 
#      faster for upper threshold, negative = faster for lower threshold) 
#      from rtdists is re-defined in a relative sense i.e., d_rtdists = t0 * d_dmc
#      so it is easy to make sure that non-decison time for both responses is
#      always positive by bounding -2 < d_dmc < 2.
