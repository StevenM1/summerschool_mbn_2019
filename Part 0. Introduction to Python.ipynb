    "So, what are Jupyter notebooks, actually? Basically, using Jupyter notebooks is like using the web-browser as a kind of editor from which you can run Python code, similar to the MATLAB interactive editor or RStudio. The cool thing about these notebooks is that they allow you to mix code \"cells\" (see below) and text \"cells\" (such as this one). The (printed) output from code blocks are displayed right below the code blocks themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two **modes**: edit mode and command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Command mode* is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin (as is the case now!): When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently (some shortcuts in command mode will be discussed later!). Enter command mode by pressing **Esc** or using the mouse to click outside a cell’s editor area; <br><br>\n",
    "- *Edit mode* is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area: When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. Enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to double-click on a cell’s editor area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're reading and scrolling through the tutorials, you'll be in the command mode mostly. But once you have to program (or write) stuff yourself, you have to switch to edit mode.
